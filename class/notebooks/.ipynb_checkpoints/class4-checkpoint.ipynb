For this purpose, we will employ Kraken which is a taxonomic sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to short DNA reads.

    "After running Trimmomatic, you should notice that the sequence quality improved (Per base sequence quality) and now it doesn't contain any contaminants/adapters (Overrepresented sequences).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, take a look at the per base sequence content graph, and notice that the head bases(~9 bp) are slightly imbalanced. In a perfect scenario, each nucleotide content should run parallel to each other, and should be reflective of the overall A/C/T/G content of your input sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quoting FastQC:\n",
    "\t\"It's worth noting that some types of library will always produce biased sequence composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries) and those which were fragmented using transposases inherit an intrinsic bias in the positions at which reads start. This bias does not concern an absolute sequence, but instead provides enrichment of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads. Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn't something which can be corrected by trimming and in most cases doesn't seem to adversely affect the downstream analysis. It will however produce a warning or error in this module.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't look very bad but you can remove the red cross sign by trimming these imbalanced head bases using HEADCROP:9 flag in the above command. This removes the first 9 bases from the start of the read. Often, the start of the read is not good quality, which is why this improves the overall read quality.\n",
