For this purpose, we will employ Kraken which is a taxonomic sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to short DNA reads. We will screen our samples against a MiniKraken database (a pre-built database constructed from complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes in NCBI RefSeq database) and confirm if the majority of reads in our sample belong to the target species.\n",

    "Filtering out problematic sequences within a dataset is inherently a trade off between sensitivity (ensuring all contaminant sequences are removed) and specificity (leaving all non-contaminant sequence data intact). Adapter and other technical contaminants can potentially occur in any location within the reads.(start, end, read-through (between the reads), partial adapter sequences)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trimmomatic is a tool that tries to search these potential contaminant/adapter sequence within the read at all the possible locations. It takes advantage of the added evidence available in paired-end dataset. In paired-end data, read-through/adapters can occur on both the forward and reverse reads of a particular fragment in the same position. Since the fragment was entirely sequenced from both ends, the non-adapter portion of the forward and reverse reads will be reverse-complements of each other. This strategy of searching for contaminant in both the reads is called 'palindrome' mode. \n",

If it finds a perfect match, It starts searching the entire adapter sequence and scores the alignment. The advantage here is that the full alignment is calculated only when there is a perfect seed match which results in considerable efficiency gains. So, When it finds a match, it moves forward with full alignment and when the match reaches 10 bp determined by simpleClipThreshold, it finally trims off the adapter from reads.  \n",

    "Quoting Trimmomatic:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'Palindrome' trimming is specifically designed for the case of 'reading through' a short fragment into the adapter sequence on the other end. In this approach, the appropriate adapter sequences are 'in silico ligated' onto the start of the reads, and the combined adapter+read sequences, forward and reverse are aligned. If they align in a manner which indicates 'read- through' i.e atleast 30 bp match, the forward read is clipped and the reverse read dropped (since it contains no new data).\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Quoting FastQC:\n",
    "\t\"It's worth noting that some types of library will always produce biased sequence composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries) and those which were fragmented using transposases inherit an intrinsic bias in the positions at which reads start. This bias does not concern an absolute sequence, but instead provides enrichment of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads. Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn't something which can be corrected by trimming and in most cases doesn't seem to adversely affect the downstream analysis. It will however produce a warning or error in this module.\"\n",

    "This doesn't look very bad but you can remove the red cross sign by trimming these imbalanced head bases using HEADCROP:9 flag in the above command. This removes the first 9 bases from the start of the read. Often, the start of the read is not good quality, which is why this improves the overall read quality.\n",
